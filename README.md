# Data-Analysis-of-Customer-Service-Request-Calls
 Customer Service Requests Analysis project. Performing data analysis of service request calls. Performing Wrangling,Cleaning the data to understand the pattern in the data and visualize the major types of complaints.
 
#### The main goal of this project was to analyze customer service requests data and gain insights into the major types of complaints, their frequency, and response times. By performing data wrangling and exploratory analysis, I aimed to identify patterns in the data that could help in improving customer service and identifying areas for improvement. The project also aimed to provide a better understanding of the types of complaints across different cities, helping in better resource allocation and planning. Ultimately, the goal was to improve customer satisfaction by addressing complaints more effectively and efficiently


#### In this project, I am Performing the following steps:

1. Understand the dataset: 
- Identify the shape of the dataset
- Identify variables with null values

2. Perform basic data exploratory analysis:
- Utilize missing value treatment
- Analyze the date column and remove the entries if it has an incorrect timeline
- Draw a frequency plot for city-wise complaints
- Draw scatter and hexabin plots for complaint concentration across Brooklyn

3. Find major types of complaints:
- Plot a bar graph of count vs. complaint types
- Find the top 10 types of complaints
- Display the types of complaints in each city in a separate dataset

4. Visualize the major types of complaints in each city

5. Check if the average response time across various types of complaints
